// Reveal layer, shown only inside the mouse-spotlight mask. The exact same
// swimmer, same lighting/background — but with the goggles off (vibrant
// blue eyes visible) and his icy-white hair flowing slightly out from under
// the cap. Generated via Higgsfield (nano_banana_2), edited from BG_IMAGE_1
// as the reference image so it's the same person/lighting/background/cap
// with only the goggles removed and the hair let loose.
